Note that what you are looking for is almost certainly in [`../raybox_game/`](../raybox_game/). This "CI2311" directory is retained only because some external references still link to it.

The `raybox_game/` directory contains everything that this `CI2311` did, plus more. It has now been made generic, intended to work on all different raybox-zero hardware implementations (though this might be a work-in-progress still).

If you found a reference pointing to this directory, please let me and/or the original author know to update their links.

For what it's worth, the point at which everything got moved was commit [`8f4009f`](https://github.com/algofoogle/raybox-zero/commit/8f4009f198333c6ad96ffd675cb20190a45b5568).
